# TADS 3.1 - ADV3 Lite Library Condensed Notes
Condensed notation on the TADS 3 library, Adv3lite. If you want, just got check out the Wiki for a much more organized version of this file. If you want a more organized version of this documentation, I suggest that you check out the [wiki](https://github.com/reneorionsalmon/tads3-Adv3-lite/wiki) for this project in the mean time. I will be working to condense this into a PDF for your use, so please be patient! 

# Why Am I Doing This?
Well, to put it simply, the manual, though extremely well-detailed and polished, was too indepth, and explained in 20 some pages what could be explained in about 5, so because I believe in "working smarter" and "not harder", I've taken the liberty of condensing some of the manual for faster learning of TADS 3. However, I am planning on making my own engine in C# as opposed to C++, like this IDE was design in the future. For now, we deal with this awesome indepth text based adventure IDE!


# Table of Contents
## Chapter 1 - The Basics
[Section 1 - The Basics](https://github.com/reneorionsalmon/tads3-Adv3-lite/wiki/Chapter-1-The-Basics) - Setting up the TADS 3 for these simple tutorials.

## Chapter 2 - Map Mapping - Rooms
[Section 1 - Rooms](https://github.com/reneorionsalmon/tads3-Adv3-lite/wiki/Ch.-2-Map-Making-Rooms-Section-1.-Your-Very-First-Room) - This section will teach you how to create rooms for your game!

[Section 2 - Coding Excursus 1: Defining Objects](https://github.com/reneorionsalmon/tads3-Adv3-lite/wiki/Ch-2.-Map-Making-Rooms-Section-2.-Coding-Excursus-1:-Defining-Objects) - This section will go more in-depth on how to define an object and more information about the Room Template.

You are taught how to create a Dark Room class that inherits from the Room class.  We discuss the "cannotGoThatWayMsg" Property, and a few excersise is given to the reader for better practice of developing more complex maps.

[Section 4 - Coding Excursus 2 â€“ Inheritance](https://github.com/reneorionsalmon/tads3-Adv3-lite/wiki/Ch-2.-Make-Making-Rooms-Section-4-Coding-Excursus-2-%E2%80%93-Inheritance) - In this section we will take a look a little further on inheritence and how it will work to our advantage when coding for our game.
